    The diagram shows the equally spaced bins (freq units apart) which this
    function will fit the data into.

    The diagram above captures all the possible collection states, allowing for
    data that belongs a partial bin on the left, zero or more bins in the middle
    and a partial bin on the right.  In the common cases there will be zero or
    one bin in bin_mid, but if measurements are come in less frequently than
    freq there may be more than one bin.

    The input data is the frequency of the bins, followed by the timestamp and
    value of the previous measurement and the timestamp and value of the current
    measurement. The measurements are expect to be counters that always
    increase.

    This code goes to great lengths to deal with allocating the remainder of
    integer division in proporionate fashion.

    Here are some examples.  In this case everything is in bin_prev:

    >>> fit_to_bins(30, 0, 0, 30, 100)
    {0: 100, 30: 0}

    The data is perfectly aligned with the bins and all of the data ends up in
    bin 0.

    In this case, there is no bin_mid at all:

    >>> fit_to_bins(30, 31, 100, 62, 213)
    {60: 7, 30: 106}

    We 29/31 of data goes into bin 30 and the remaining 2/31 goes into bin 60.
    The example counter values here were chosen to show how the remainder code
    operates.

    In this case there is no bin_mid, everything is in bin_prev or bin_curr:

    >>> fit_to_bins(30, 90, 100, 121, 200)
    {120: 3, 90: 97}

    30/31 of the data goes into bin 90 and 1/31 goes into bin 120.

    This example shows where bin_mid is larger than one:

    >>> fit_to_bins(30, 89, 100, 181, 200)
    {120: 33, 180: 1, 90: 33, 60: 0, 150: 33}
